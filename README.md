  Hello! I am Arun, a CS student at Alagappa Chettiar Government College of Engineering and Technology. Currently learning Machine Learning and Fullstack Web Development. Working on some pretty cool web products as a side project. I primarily code with Python but am expanding my horizon to new tools based on the application domain.</div>
